Using SOLID to design structure:

Controllers handle incoming requests and delegate tasks to services.
Services contain business logic and interact with repositories for data access.
Repositories handle database interactions (CRUD operations) for specific entities.
DTOs define data structures for input/output in API requests.
Entities represent data models mapped to database tables.
